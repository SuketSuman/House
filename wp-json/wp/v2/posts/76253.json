All are still taking applications, but many are deferring decisions for an indeterminate amount of time, which is understandable but frustrating for applicants. Indeed, we have several clients on the cusp of a decision who may now have to wait until their local planning department re-opens fully. Others are now struggling to get third-party services such as tree surveys, biodiversity studies and topographical surveys carried out due to extended wait times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are fortunate that in the last few weeks, despite everything that has gone on, we have still been able to carry on business with some sense of normality. We have secured a number of planning approvals; the only downside for these clients is that it&#8217;s unclear when building work will be able to commence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, we should celebrate any small victories. Our Lincolnshire planning application for this beautiful, traditionally-styled family home near Boston, was approved earlier this week with a minimum of fuss. Thanks should go out to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mybostonuk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Boston Borough Council<\/a> for their support of the proposal, and hopefully it won&#8217;t be too long before our clients can start making the approved design into a reality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are remaining open for business and can help you achieve the same on the journey to your dream home. We offer <a href=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/custom-house-plan-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">custom designs<\/a> as well as our stock house plans, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/planning-application-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">full planning service<\/a> to help you negotiate your way to planning approval. <a href=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/self-build-advice-contact-form\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Contact us<\/a> today to find out more.<\/p>\n\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-76253\" data-postid=\"76253\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-76253 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While some Local Planning Departments have closed down altogether, and many are offering a very restricted service, others are managing to carry on as normal.
