This leads on to remedial work being carried out to put things right before the final inspection. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to create a snagging list by inspecting the completed works together with your builder so that you can establish what needs to be done. Your builder should then arrange for one or more of his team to deal with the snagging list and ensure that everything on it is completed to an agreed standard \u2013 this is known as \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.designingbuildings.co.uk\/wiki\/Making_good\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">making good<\/a>\u201d. \u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you are self-building you are likely to have had different tradesmen on site so you still need to create a snagging list. You can then contact the tradesmen involved to resolve any issues. In the case of either using a builder or individual tradesman, it is advisable that your contract with them includes a clause about retention money so that you can hold this back until the work has been completed to your satisfaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your list should include minor faults but also anything that differs from the specification.&nbsp; Common problems that you can pick up at snagging include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Paintwork not completed, paint runs, marked paintwork<\/li><li>Windows, doors, drawers not fitted properly<\/li><li>Latches, locks and bolts not working properly<\/li><li>Paint on door handles and hinges<\/li><li>Signs of leaks<\/li><li>Damage to kitchen worktop edges<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We have just added an extensive <a href=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/product\/new-home-snagging-list\/\">New Home Snagging List<\/a> to our website \u2013 click here to find out more.<\/p>\n\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-76706\" data-postid=\"76706\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-76706 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Unless you have worked in the construction industry, you will probably never have heard of the term \u201csnagging\u201d.\u00a0 So you may be wondering &#8220;what is a snagging list?&#8221; If you are about to start, or are working on, a self build project you will need to know about snagging before the completion and handover of [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":76708,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_editorskit_title_hidden":false,"_editorskit_reading_time":0,"_editorskit_is_block_options_detached":false,"_editorskit_block_options_position":"{}","_uag_custom_page_level_css":""},"categories":[93],"tags":[],"acf":[],"featured_image_urls":{"full":["https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/what-is-a-snagging-list.jpg",800,600,false],"thumbnail":["https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/what-is-a-snagging-list-200x150.jpg",200,150,true],"medium":["https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/what-is-a-snagging-list-700x525.jpg",700,525,true],"medium_large":["https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/what-is-a-snagging-list-768x576.jpg",768,576,true],"large":["https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/what-is-a-snagging-list.jpg",800,600,false],"1536x1536":["https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/what-is-a-snagging-list.jpg",800,600,false],"2048x2048":["https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/what-is-a-snagging-list.jpg",800,600,false],"woocommerce_thumbnail":["https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/what-is-a-snagging-list-400x300.jpg",400,300,true],"woocommerce_single":["https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/what-is-a-snagging-list.jpg",800,600,false],"woocommerce_gallery_thumbnail":["https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/what-is-a-snagging-list-100x100.jpg",100,100,true]},"post_excerpt_stackable":"<p>Unless you have worked in the construction industry, you will probably never have heard of the term \u201csnagging\u201d.\u00a0 So you may be wondering &#8220;what is a snagging list?&#8221; If you are about to start, or are working on, a self build project you will need to know about snagging before the completion and handover of your build.\u00a0 So what is a snagging list?
