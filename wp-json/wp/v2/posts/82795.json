We offer a wide variety of bungalow designs which display enormous diversity and customisation elements.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the numerous advantages of bungalow designs, the word &#8220;bungalow&#8221; still evokes negative connotations and ideas. Although many people and developers disregard bungalows, they have a vast amount of advantages. Especially for an increasingly ageing population, bungalows are perfect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog, we will discuss our top 5 modern bungalow plans.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Blakemere<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/product\/four-bedroom-bungalow-plan-blakemere\/\" class=\"ek-link\">The Blakemere<\/a> design offers an expansive four-bedroom bungalow. This contemporary design boasts large areas of open-plan living. As a result, this modern bungalow is perfect for families that enjoy hosting events.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great appeal to this bungalow is the expansive areas of glazing. In addition to the large glazed areas, the design has two sets of bifold doors at the rear. The Blakemere allows self-builders to connect spaces; opening up indoor space with the outdoors.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Blakemere-2021-alt-finishes-1-1-1024x768.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82797\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Lucton&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/product\/lucton-cabin-style-house-plan\/\" class=\"ek-link\">The Lucton<\/a> is a contemporary cabin-style bungalow plan that combines the advantages of modern construction with the ease of country living. This bungalow plan compliments a countryside plot where you can take full advantage of the contemporary corner window for an almost seamless view of your surroundings. In addition, the Lucton has rooflights integrated into the design to bring in natural light without the need for large expansive glazed areas.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The floor plan for this design displays the best of both worlds. Homeowners can benefit from both open-plan main living spaces as well as three secluded double bedrooms. A study, family bathroom and utility room complete the layout.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Lucton-Front-View-2-1600-1-1024x768.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82798\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Sutton&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This fully modernised bungalow breaks away from traditional stereotypes. For many years, bungalows have been associated with the elderly, tired designs and dingy interiors. Not anymore.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a completely modernised design aesthetic, <a href=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/product\/the-sutton-modern-bungalow-design\/\" class=\"ek-link\">The Sutton<\/a> features large glazing facades, full-height windows, contemporary finishes and modern styling. These numerous modern features bring bungalows into the 21st century.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expansive glazed areas will channel an abundance of natural light and provide beautiful uninterrupted views.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This modern bungalow boasts three well-proportioned bedrooms complementing the extensive entertaining space. Our standard design shows the living and kitchen\/dining area separated by an internal wall. Although this modern bungalow promotes open living, this small wall can provide privacy for family members.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"573\" src=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Modern-Bungalow-Design-The-Sutton-Houseplansdirect-1024x573.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82802\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Turnastone&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This beautiful modern bungalow design features a light and airy look. <a href=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/product\/contemporary-bungalow-design-turnastone\/\" class=\"ek-link\">The Turnastone<\/a> provides natural sunlight through roof windows and an expansive glazed facade at the front.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This modern bungalow design is a modest size. It offers both large open-plan living\/dining areas, as well as two double bedrooms which offer increased privacy. This particular layout lends itself to further future expansion should you need to accommodate a growing family.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" src=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Contemporary-Bungalow-Design-The-Turnastone-1024x575.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82801\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Queenswood&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This contemporary bungalow has been designed with a modest and unassuming entrance, contrasted by an incredible glazed facade to the rear.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entering the property you are greeted by a spectacular living area, with full-height glazing to take in breathless views where you can enjoy sunrises and sunsets. Adjoining this huge entertaining space is the spacious kitchen\/diner, which benefits from its french doors and access to the rear. The french doors open up to nature.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/product\/bungalow-design-queenswood\/\" class=\"ek-link\">The Queenswood<\/a> modern bungalow design offers flexibility with rooms. Depending on the number of bedrooms you require, the third bedroom can be used for a study or home office.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"572\" src=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/Bungalow-Design-for-Self-Build-The-Queenswood-1024x572.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82803\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Modern Bungalow House Plan Prices<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get in touch with <strong>Houseplansdirect<\/strong> to find and customise the perfect house plan for your self-build venture.
