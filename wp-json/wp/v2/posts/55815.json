But don&#8217;t just restrict yourself to what we&#8217;ve come up with &#8211; each plan can be customised exactly how you want it. This is how to make those changes:<\/p>\n<h4>1. Pick a floor plan that works.<\/h4>\n<p>Getting the floor plan right is the most critical part of the design. External finishes, door and window styles can all be changed at any of a number of different stages as the design evolves. But getting your layout right at the start will save a lot of headaches further down the line. So think about walking in through that front door &#8211; how do you picture it? Would you walk straight into the living room, or a hall, or would you access the property through a side door into a utility room? Do the stairs and hallway separate the living and dining areas or do you prefer open plan? Remember that once the floor plan is settled, everything else can grow around it.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Decide on the general look and feel you like.<\/h4>\n<p>You probably have an idea of how you&#8217;d like the home to look already, so don&#8217;t be put off if our images don&#8217;t show it that way. If you like a floor plan but want to change the appearance from a traditional British style to a contemporary European-style timber-and-glass structure, we can do that, and have done before! One previous customer liked the floorplan of the <a title=\"The Allensmore\" href=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/houseplans\/four-bedroom-house-plans\/modern-townhouse-designs-allensmore\/\">Allensmore<\/a>, but wanted it redesigned to resemble a Scandinavian chalet, so we revamped it for her.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-55822 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/\/2015\/03\/Allensmore-to-Scandinavia-700x263.jpg\" alt=\"designing your own home\" width=\"700\" height=\"263\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s one of the more extreme makeovers we&#8217;ve done, but it&#8217;s a great example of the flexibility you have once the layout is in place.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Take inspiration from everywhere!<\/h4>\n<p>Browse manufacturers&#8217; catalogues, read home design magazines, watch Grand Designs and look at what other people have done. You can pick elements from all of these sources and combine them to create something truly unique. Maybe even set up at <a href=\"https:\/\/uk.pinterest.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinterest<\/a> board to store all the little scraps of information for future reference. You \u00a0genuinely can adopt any style you like when designing your own home these days (subject to local planners&#8217; whims, of course) so be creative!<\/p>\n<h4>4. Consider the local vernacular.<\/h4>\n<p>One mitigating piece of advice is that the local planners will always have final say on your design, and the &#8216;local vernacular&#8217; is something that they are generally quite protective of. For the uninitiated, this means that they will look at elements of your design such as external finishes (brick, timber, stone, render), windows (size and style) and roofing, and consider whether your proposals would be inappropriate for your surroundings. So you may have to compromise a little, but this is an easy and painless amendment to make.<\/p>\n<h4>5.
