Would you consider buying a property just to re-use the land, or knocking down your existing home?\u00a0 Due to the severe shortage of available land in the UK it is estimated that over 50% of self builders are looking to demolish and replace a dwelling, with the percentage likely to continue to increase.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/demolish-and-replace-a-dwelling.jpg\" alt=\"demolish and replace a dwelling\" class=\"wp-image-75403\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>So, how do you demolish and replace a dwelling? Where do you start?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first instance, you need to do some initial research as to whether the property you are considering is suitable for redevelopment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main issues that you need to think about are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>a) whether it is an option financially,  and<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>b) whether you are likely to get planning permission for your plans. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will need to take into account the cost of demolition (which may include issues such as removing asbestos), planning permission, and the cost of building your new property. Any redevelopment project will require planning permission from your local authority and it is advisable to seek a pre-application meeting with them to gauge whether your project is likely to be looked upon favourably (although the small print will tell you that the advice given is not legally binding!). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, planners will not object to a replacement property up to 30% larger than the original dwelling footprint and they often prefer to see a design that will fit in with the local area. It is not usually a requirement to gain planning permission to demolish the original dwelling as this comes under \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.planningportal.co.uk\/info\/200187\/your_responsibilities\/37\/planning_permission\/2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"permitted development (opens in a new tab)\">permitted development<\/a>\u201d but check this with the planners beforehand as buildings that are listed or in a conservation area may not have permitted development rights.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of advantages to replacing an existing\nproperty. At the end of the process you will have a home designed to exactly\nhow you want it, a new build will be zero rated for VAT, you will be more\nlikely to get planning permission because a residential property has previously\nbeen established and your essential services (electricity, water, drainage etc)\nwill already be in place, which can be a huge cost saving. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our \u201cTen Minute Guide to Redevelopment\u201d will be available on the site soon! In the meantime, check out some of our designs and see which might be a suitable replacement dwelling &#8211; our <a href=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/product-category\/self-build-house-plans\/dormer-bungalow-designs\/\">dormer bungalows<\/a> often make good candidates. <\/p>\n\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-75400\" data-postid=\"75400\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-75400 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you been searching for some time for the right plot of land in the right location to build your dream home?
