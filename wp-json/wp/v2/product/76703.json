Read our blog post about <a href=\"https:\/\/houseplansdirect.co.uk\/blog\/what-is-a-snagging-list\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the importance of snagging<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions<\/h2>\n<h3>Why buy our new home snagging list?<\/h3>\n<p>It is important to ensure that any minor defects are corrected before your builder hands over your new home, as it will avoid any issues futher down the line. You can even issue the snagging list to your builder in advance, so they know the standard you expect and what you will be looking for.<\/p>\n<h3>What if I&#8217;m building the new home myself?<\/h3>\n<p>Even if you are doing the majority of work yourself, you are still likely to have had some contractors on site for specialist works (electrics, groundwork etc.) so snagging their work is still vitally important. And there is, of course, no reason not to snag your own work before signing it off as a job well done!<\/p>\n<h3>Can you send the new home specification template to me in Mac \/ Open Office \/ any other format?<\/h3>\n<p>No, but you can download the PDF version and convert it yourself \u2013 many other programmes will open this format and there is also an abundance of free converters online.<\/p>\n<h3>How do I resolve any issues picked up by the snagging list?<\/h3>\n<p>Your builder \/ contractor should be asked to put right any defects (known as &#8216;making good&#8217;) before handing over. It is usual to have a clause in any contract with a builder that final payment is retained until making good has been completed, so this snagging list gives you a comprehensive resource from which to inspect their work.<\/p>\n<!--themify_builder_content-->\n<div id=\"themify_builder_content-76703\" data-postid=\"76703\" class=\"themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-76703 themify_builder tf_clear\">\n    <\/div>\n<!--\/themify_builder_content-->\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18.72px;\">Our &#8216;New Home Snagging List&#8217; is a comprehensive 27-page checklist used to ensure that all workmanship has been carried out to an acceptable standard.
